# Dengue-Mosquito-Detection-Using-Matlab

### Project Overview

### Motivation
Dengue fever is a major public health concern in Sri Lanka, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Effective control of dengue-carrying mosquitoes is crucial to reducing the incidence of the disease. This project aims to develop a method for detecting dengue mosquitoes using their characteristic wingbeat frequencies, leveraging digital signal processing techniques.

### Purpose
This project was undertaken as part of the Digital Signal Processing module in the 5th semester at the University of Jaffna. The primary goal is to identify dengue mosquitoes by analyzing the frequency domain of their wingbeat sounds.

### Key Highlights
- **Frequency Domain Analysis:** The project focuses on identifying specific frequency bands associated with dengue mosquitoes. The characteristic frequency bands identified are:
  - 550-650 Hz
  - 1050-1200 Hz
  - 1650-1800 Hz

- **Accuracy Metrics:**
  - Dengue Detection Accuracy: 86.6%
  - Non-Dengue Detection Accuracy: 79.2%
  - Overall Accuracy: 83%

## Features
- **Frequency Band Tuning:** Careful tuning of frequency bands to achieve optimal detection accuracy.
- **Signal Processing:** Utilizes advanced digital signal processing techniques to analyze mosquito wingbeat sounds.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representation of frequency domain analysis to differentiate between dengue and non-dengue mosquitoes.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Record mosquito sounds in a controlled environment.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the recorded sound signals for analysis.
3. **Frequency Analysis:** Apply Fourier Transform to convert time-domain signals to frequency domain.
4. **Band Identification:** Identify and isolate the characteristic frequency bands of dengue mosquitoes.
5. **Classification:** Use machine learning algorithms to classify the mosquitoes based on their frequency domain characteristics.

## Results
The project successfully identifies dengue mosquitoes with an accuracy of 86.6%. The methodology demonstrates a significant potential for practical applications in dengue mosquito control and public health surveillance.
